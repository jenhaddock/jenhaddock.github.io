My first introduciton into programming was an elective high school class. I knew then that I enjoyed programming, but I saw programming as a career for people smarter than myself.  Instead I majored in Accounting through my college's Business School.  As a requirement for my Accounting degree, my junior year I took an Accounting Information Systems class - a hybrid between Accounting and Computer Information Systems.  I was hooked.  I loved that class more than I loved any of my Accounting classes and I approached our final project with a gusto I didn't know I had.  An offhanded comment by my professor about how I had figured out a part of our final project no one else had ever figured out on their own made me realize I was smart enough to code for a living  .At that point I was set to graduate college in 3 years so I added Computer Information Systems as a second degree. 
For 10 years I worked as a COBOL developer (yes, it does still exist!).  For the past year I've worked as a SQL developer.  I came to Flatiron because I miss the satisfaction that comes with creating a finished project but I felt my skills were outdated.  I'm looking forward to learning languages I didn't get a chance to learn in college and creating new projects.
