My first introduciton into programming was an elective high school class. I knew then that I enjoyed programming, but I felt like business was a more realistic major.  Instead I majored in Accounting through my college's Business School.  As a requirement for my Accounting degree, my junior year I took an Accounting Information Systems class - a hybrid between Accounting and Computer Information Systems.  I was hooked.  I loved that class more than I loved any of my Accounting classes and I approached our final project with a gusto I didn't know I had.  An offhanded comment by my professor about how I had figured out a part of our final project no one else had ever figured out on their own made me realize I could code for a living and actually be good at it. At that point I was set to graduate college in 3 years so I added Computer Information Systems as a second degree.

For 10 years I worked as a COBOL developer (yes, it does still exist!).  For the past year I've worked as a SQL developer.  I came to Flatiron because I miss the satisfaction that comes with creating a finished project and I wanted to learn more progressive languages.  I'm learning things here that weren't around when I was in college and I love expanding my coding knowledge.
