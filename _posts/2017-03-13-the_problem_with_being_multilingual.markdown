Last week I found myself in an interesting situation while working at my job as a SQL developer.  I needed to find the length of a field, which I hadn't done in awhile, but all I could remember was the way to find length in Ruby. I knew they weren't anywhere near the same, but for the life of me I couldn't remember the (very simple) way to find length in SQL.  Having worked in Cobol long enough for it to become second nature, I began to wonder when it will become the same for me in SQL.  And futhermore, what happens when you're regularly working in multiple languages?  Will I be able to keep each language separate?  
<br> After a year of working in SQL, things were definitely starting to become more acquired before I added Ruby into the mix.  I'm interested to see what happens when I start learning Javascript.  Will I forget Ruby? Or will I try to sprinkle Ruby elements into Javascript?  
<br>In the end I hope I'm able to maintain my knowledge of all coding languages at the same time.  And if I forget a simple command again, then thank goodness for stackoverflow.
