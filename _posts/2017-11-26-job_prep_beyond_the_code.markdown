Knowing how to code is obviously a key factor in finding a job post graduation.  But knowing how to prove you know the code is also important.  <br>
I've never been one of those people who can eloquently answer a question when put on the spot.  Job interviews have always been hard for me.  I stammer, I umm and I ahhh.  So in an effort to make myself more marketable to employers, I joined [Toastmasters](http://https://www.toastmasters.org/).<br>
I was somewhat familiar with Toastmasters as my employer has a branch that meets once a week.  But I thought it was all about making speeches.  In reality, it's more than that.  While each meeting does include prepared speeches, there is also a portion of each meeting that involves impromptu speaking.  You're given a question and given 1 to 2 minutes to answer. 
This portion of the meetings has been most helpful to me.  Being put on the spot and having to answer right away has made me a more confident public speaker.  I'm learning to remove the stammers I make when I get nervous and eliminate crutch words I use as fillers when I don't know what to say.  And while I still don't like speaking in public, I'm at least getting more comfortable doing so.  <br>
Each meeting also provides leadership opportunites in the form of timing speakers, facilitating the impromptu portion of the meeting and evaluating speakers.  I'm definitely a work in progress, but I'm confident that I am improving skills that will help me in my future job search.
